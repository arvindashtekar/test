##### Now that the service is up, visit `http://localhost:8080/greeting`, where you see:

```json
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

___

##### Provide a `name` query string parameter with `http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User`.

```json
{"id":2,"content":"Hello, User!"}
```

##### `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
* `@Configuration` tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration` tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
* Normally you would add `@EnableWebMvc` for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.
* `@ComponentScan` tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the package, allowing it to find the `GreetingController`.

___

##### The Spring Boot gradle plugin provides many convenient features:

* It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable `über-jar`, which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
* It searches for the `public static void main()` method to flag as a runnable class.
* It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match Spring Boot dependencies. You can override any version you wish, but it will default to Boot’s chosen set of versions.
